It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, and designed by architect Lal Chand Ustad.

These windows allow cool air to circulate through the palace, making it comfortable even during the hot summers—hence the name “Palace of Winds”.This architectural marvel is a fine example of Rajput and Mughal styles and remains one of Jaipur’s most iconic landmarks. It is located near the City Palace and Jantar Mantar, making it a popular stop for tourists exploring the rich heritage of the Pink City.</p>
